# Assignment2

Your task is to implement the EM algorithm for mixtures of multivariate Bernoulli distributions. Please use the R template below to solve the assignment. Then, use your implementation to show what happens when your mixture model has too few and too many components, i.e. set K=2,3,4 and compare results. Please provide a short explanation as well.
